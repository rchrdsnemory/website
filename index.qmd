Hi! I'm an applied data scientist. I build experiments and statistical models to find the difference-that-makes-a-difference in behavior, beliefs, and decisons.

Things I get excited about: data, puzzles, theory, statistical methods, good writing, philosophy of science, social network topologies & their influence on cumulative culture, learning strategies based on conformity / Condorcet methods / “the wisdom of crowds”, the spread of (mis)information, languages, and funky bass. Also kettlebells.

past: postdoc @ UMich | PhD @ Yale | MAPSS @ UChicago
      RPCV @ US Peace Corps | Philosophy & History of Science @ stjohnscollege
